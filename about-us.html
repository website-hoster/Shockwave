    <h1>Humanicism</h1>
    <p><strong>Universal Definition:</strong> Humanicism is an integrated system of thought and praxis rooted in rationality, logic, and the human capacity for discernment, designed to coherently and uniformly guide both individual life and collective organization.</p>
    <p>Its mission is to foster a universal environment where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Freedom coexists with responsibility: Personal liberty is balanced by respect for the rights and dignity of others.</li>
      <li>Diversity flourishes alongside cohesion: Mutual respect, empathy, and understanding foster genuine social cohesion and cooperation.</li>
      <li>Progress is pursued carefully and responsibly: Ethical, sustainable progress respects individuals, benefits society, and preserves the natural balance of our world.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Humanicism is built on the belief that humanity is capable of designing a future that is functional, meaningful, and reflective of our highest potential.</p>
